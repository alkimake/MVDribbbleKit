# MVDribbbleKit
MVDribbbleKit is a modern and simple Objective-C wrapper for the official [Dribbble API](https://dribbble.com/api).

No dependencies are needed, but iOS 7 or later is required.

## Usage
To use this wrapper, simply drag & drop the MVDribbbleKit folder to your project and `#import "MVDribbbleKit.h"`.

There are also three model classes (MVComment, MVShot and MVPlayer).
